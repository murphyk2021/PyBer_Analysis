# Module 5:  PyBer with Matplotlib
---
## Overview of the Analysis
In this day and age, it is of utmost importance to be able to communicate information quickly and effectively to your audience.  I this module we were introduced to the Matplot library which is an excellent tool for creating professional, clean, and customizable visual representations of large data sets.  To practice with this library we worked with "Omar" to prepare a presentation for "V. isualize", the CEO of the fictional company PyBer. In this activity the CEO was interested in how the rideshare service was being used in different types of cities.  With this data the company hopes to allocate resources appropriately in the future to generate even more financial returns.  We prepared for our presentation by cleaning the data, merging the dataframes provided, creating new dataframes, and running basic statistics on the data.  Finally we used our analysis to create several graphs to display correlations between:
- type of city
- number of drivers
- number of uses
- average fare

## Results

After sifting through the data we can conclude:
 - **there are more drivers in urban cities,** 
 - **the rideshare service is used the most frequently in urban cities,**
 - **the lowest average fare per ride is in urban cities,**
 - **the most total revenue comes from urban cities.**

Additionally, we can conclude that there is fluctuation from week to week in the revenue gained in all types of cities.

## Summary
These conclusions are not particularly surprising as populations residing in urban cities are less likely to own or regularly use individual vehicles.  Additionally, residents of urban cities are likely using the ride share service for shorter trips than those living in rural areas where businesses and homes are more spread out geographically.  To get even more robust data, it would be interesting to compare the population size/age, household ncome, and weather data to these different parameters.  For example:
 - What percentage of the total population uses the service?
 - Is there a correlation between usage and household income?
 - Is the service used more frequently during the week(for commuting) or on weekends(pleasure)?
 - Is there a correlation between weather and the total number of rides?
 - Which age range utilizes the service most frequently?
